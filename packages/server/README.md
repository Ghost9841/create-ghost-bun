# New Boilerplate: Ghost Bun Boilerplate

Hey, I just published a boilerplate to help you spin up a Bun + TypeScript + Fullstack project in seconds 

# Prerequisites
- [Bun Installed](https://bun.com/)
- [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

# Create a new project
```npx @technest/create-ghost-bun my-app```
# (replace "my-app" with your project name)

# After setup
# Frontend only
```cd my-app/packages/client && bun install```
```cd my-app/packages/client && bun run dev```

# Backend only
``` cd my-app/packages/server && bun install```
``` cd my-app/packages/server && bun run dev```

# Both frontend & backend together in root folder (my-app)
```bun i && bun run dev```

# What you get
- Bun for fast installs & dev server
- React + Vite frontend
- TypeScript everywhere
- Clean server setup
- Ready-to-use scripts

This is just v1 — I’d love to know what features you want added next.
